      You’re the one people admire. The one who makes things happen. The one who’s built a life others envy.
      But behind closed doors, you’re exhausted. Unfulfilled.

      <h3>THE LIE YOU’VE BEEN SOLD</h3>
      <p>You were told success would bring happiness. That if you just worked harder, earned more, optimized everything—you’d finally feel at peace.</p>
      <p><strong>But here’s the truth no one tells you:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You can’t outperform emptiness.</strong> Another achievement won’t fix it.</li>
        <li><strong>Burnout isn’t a badge of honor.</strong> It’s a sign you’ve been chasing the wrong thing.</li>
        <li><strong>Thinking your way into fulfillment is impossible.</strong> You don’t need another strategy—you need a radical shift in how you relate to yourself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Success wasn’t the problem. The problem was believing it would make you whole.</p>
      <p><strong>And if you don’t face this now, when will you?</strong></p>

    <!-- Section 2: I GET IT BECAUSE I LIVED IT. -->
    <section id="lived-it">
      <h3>I GET IT BECAUSE I LIVED IT.</h3>
      <p>For 15 years, I lived the dream most people chase. I performed at the biggest festivals in the world, made more money than I ever imagined, and built a name that commanded attention.</p>
      <p>And yet, late at night, when the crowd was gone and the music faded, I felt hollow.</p>
      <p>I told myself the next milestone would fix it. But when I finally admitted the truth, I did something most people would never dare—I walked away.</p>
      <p>I sold nearly everything I owned, left my home, ended my relationship, and sat on my childhood bed with nothing but silence.</p>
      <p>And in that silence, I asked myself the question that changed my life:</p>
      <blockquote><strong>“What do I truly desire?”</strong></blockquote>
      <p>Because if I didn’t figure it out then, I knew I’d spend my life pretending I didn’t need to.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Section 3: WHY YOU’RE STILL STUCK -->
    <section id="stuck">
      <h3>WHY YOU’RE STILL STUCK</h3>
      <p>I know why you haven’t cracked this yet. And I know the thoughts running through your head because I’ve lived them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“I don’t have time for this.”</strong> → But how much longer do you want to wait, hoping things will magically feel better?</li>
        <li><strong>“I should be able to figure this out myself.”</strong> → If intellect alone could fix this, wouldn’t you be at peace by now?</li>
        <li><strong>“What if I change and lose my edge?”</strong> → <em>You don’t need suffering to be successful. You need alignment.</em></li>
        <li><strong>“What if I dig into this and realize I’ve been living a lie?”</strong> → <em>That fear is the biggest proof that you need to do this work. Because deep down, you already know something has to change.</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You don’t need more willpower. You don’t need another framework.</p>
      <p>You need to stop running from yourself.</p>
      <p><strong>Or you can keep waiting and wake up ten years from now, still wondering why you feel this way.</strong></p>

    <!-- Section 4: WHAT WORKING TOGETHER LOOKS LIKE -->
    <section id="working-together">
      <h3>WHAT WORKING TOGETHER LOOKS LIKE</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1:1 Deep Coaching Sessions</strong> – I see the thing you don’t. The blind spot that’s been keeping you stuck.</li>
        <li><strong>3-Month Developmental Container</strong> – 12 sessions designed for lasting transformation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>This isn’t just coaching.</strong></p>
      <p>This is about stepping into the life that’s been waiting for you.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Section 5: THE CONVERSATION THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING -->
    <section id="conversation">
      <h3>THE CONVERSATION THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING</h3>
      <p>There’s a reason top performers are willing to invest six figures in a single coaching relationship.</p>
      <p>Because one powerful conversation can shift your entire trajectory.</p>
      <p>If you’ve built everything you thought you wanted and still feel like something’s missing, I invite you into a conversation that will show you why.</p>
      <p>Not everyone is ready for this. But if you are, book a call.</p>
      <p>And if you’re not? That’s fine too. Just don’t waste another year pretending this feeling will go away on its own.</p>
