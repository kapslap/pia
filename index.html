    <h2>You’re building the Intelligence of a God.</h2>
    <h1>Do you have the Wisdom to wield it?</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      You're at the forefront of the greatest existential challenge of our era—AI Alignment.
      Your intelligence is profound, your impact unmatched. But even the most brilliant minds
      hit a wall: stress, burnout, overwhelm.
    </p>
    <p>What if the missing piece isn't working harder or smarter—but accessing deeper wisdom?</p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      I get it—I’ve been there. Throughout my twenties, I battled intense mental health struggles,
      constantly spinning in circles, feeling burnt out and stuck. Like you, I had intelligence—
      but something critical was missing. I tried every method, every technique, every "fix."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I discovered a radically different approach: one that didn't see me as something to
      be "fixed," but as something ready to naturally unfold. By welcoming every part of myself—
      including the uncomfortable ones—I found unprecedented clarity, flow, and purpose.
    </p>
    <p>That experience changed my life.</p>

    <p>
      Now, I bring that exact approach—integrating ethical inquiry, presence-based unfolding,
      and deep embodiment—to visionary AI researchers like you. Your intelligence is
      extraordinary; now let’s integrate it with deep wisdom so you can sustainably and
      wisely shape humanity’s future.
