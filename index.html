    <h2>You’re building the Intelligence of a God.</h2>
    <h1>Do you have the Wisdom to wield it?</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>Your Deepest Work Requires Your Deepest Wisdom</h2>
    <p>
      You're at the forefront of the greatest existential challenge of our era—AI Alignment.
      Your intelligence is profound, your impact unmatched. But even the most brilliant minds
      hit walls: stress, burnout, overwhelm.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if the missing piece isn't working harder or smarter—but accessing deeper wisdom?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet often, subtle barriers prevent us from accessing this wisdom—persistent stress,
      emotional overwhelm, a sense of disconnection, or simply feeling that something fundamental
      is missing.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>A New Approach to Break Through Burnout</h2>
    <p>
      I deeply understand this challenge because I’ve experienced it myself. Throughout my twenties,
      despite my intelligence and determination, I repeatedly hit burnout and stress cycles. No matter
      how hard I tried, something fundamental always felt missing: clarity, direction, ease. It became
      obvious that continuing to push harder wasn’t the answer—things kept breaking, leaving me stuck
      and overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I discovered a radically different approach—one rooted not in effort and force, but in
      acceptance, integration, and building my capacity to fully experience and move through
      internal barriers. Rather than avoiding or resisting my emotional blocks, I learned to
      use them as signals, creating immediate shifts toward clarity, flow, and purpose.
    </p>
    <p>This profoundly changed my life.</p>
    <p>
      Now, I bring this exact approach—integrating ethical inquiry, presence-based unfolding,
      and emotional clarity—to visionary AI researchers like you. Your intelligence is
      extraordinary; now let’s integrate it with the wisdom needed to sustainably shape
      humanity’s future.
