    <h2>AI Researchers: You’re Building the Intelligence of a God.</h2>
    <h1>Do You Have the Wisdom to Wield It?</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>Your Deepest Work Demands Your Deepest Self</h2>
    <p>
      You’re solving humanity’s most complex challenges. You sit at the bleeding edge of intelligence,
      wielding tools that shape civilization. But intelligence alone isn’t enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      To lead wisely, you must integrate fast, resolve what clouds your insight, and deepen your access
      to inner clarity—now, not later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stress, burnout, emotional dysregulation, relational tensions—these aren’t side issues.
      They’re signals. What if they weren’t obstacles, but invitations?
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Why I Offer This Work</h2>
    <p>
      I asked myself: What’s the most impactful thing I can do with my time?
      The answer was clear—supporting those whose decisions shape the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      You.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work exists to serve you—the brilliant, burdened minds building and aligning AI.
      You don’t need more productivity hacks. You need a space where your deepest intelligence—
      your wisdom—can be felt, heard, and embodied.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Is Different Than Any Coaching You’ve Tried</h2>
    <p>
      Most coaching helps you fix problems, optimize performance, or push harder toward your goals.
      It assumes you’re not enough—yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>This is different.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach—called Unfoldment—isn’t about fixing. It’s about meeting what’s present with
      precision, presence, and love. Together, we’ll enter the moment as it is, not how you wish it were—
      and something deep will shift.
    </p>
    <p>We work across three distinct layers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Parts Work</strong> – Discover the inner protectors, exiled emotions, and impulses that shape your behavior. They aren’t problems—they’re trying to help. When seen and welcomed, they soften.</li>
      <li><strong>Process Work</strong> – Track the subtle, felt shifts in your body. Learn how to listen to the signals that don’t come in words but guide everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Presence Work</strong> – Drop into direct contact with innate capacities like courage, clarity, compassion, and joy. You don’t need to create these—they’re already in you, waiting to be accessed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This isn’t mindset work. It’s not therapy. It’s a deeper kind of clarity—emergent, embodied,
      and grounded in your actual experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters for AI Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      You already know this is more than just a technical challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your choices, your clarity, your presence—they shape the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you integrate faster, lead with coherence, and move from your deepest values,
      your work becomes exponentially more effective. You waste less energy. You solve from signal,
      not stress. You become more trustworthy to yourself—and to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how wisdom scales.

    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Jared did a fantastic job holding space for me, making me feel safe to express my feelings as we explored emotionally-challenging aspects of my psychology. As a result of his prompting, guidance, and reflection, I’ve developed powerful internal metaphors for understanding parts of my personality that have given me confidence in making difficult decisions and dealing with uncertainty. Thank you so much, Jared!”</p>
      <span class="quote-author">— David Shimel</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“I’m learning from Jared how to accept myself and bring warmth and softness and gentle kindness into my own body. And be at rest.
