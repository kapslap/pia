    <h2>AI Researchers: You're Building the Intelligence of a God.</h2>
    <h1>Do You Have the Wisdom to Wield It?</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>Your Deepest Work Requires Your Deepest Wisdom</h2>
    <p>
      You're at the forefront of humanity's greatest existential challenge—AI Alignment.
      Your intelligence is profound, your impact unmatched. But even the most brilliant minds
      hit walls: stress, burnout, overwhelm.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if the missing piece isn't working harder or smarter—but accessing deeper wisdom?
    </p>
    <p>
      Subtle barriers often prevent us from accessing this wisdom—persistent stress,
      emotional overwhelm, disconnection, or simply feeling that something fundamental
      is missing.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Why I’m Offering These Sessions</h2>
    <p>
      I recently sat with a deep personal inquiry: "What's the most impactful thing I could be doing 
      with my time?" 
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer became clear: offering coaching sessions specifically for you—the brilliant minds 
      addressing humanity's toughest challenges. I'm currently seeking 2-3 clients to engage with 
      weekly, between 2-6pm EST. These sessions are donation-based, accessible to anyone who needs 
      support.
    </p>

    <h2>The Cost of Skipping Integration</h2>
    <p>
      If your time is worth $500 an hour, consider what you stand to lose by not integrating key 
      insights, resolving blind spots, and sharpening your decisions. A single hour of structured 
      reflection could save you days—or even weeks—of low productivity, preventing thousands of 
      dollars in lost output.
    </p>
    <p>
      One clear strategic shift can yield a tenfold impact on project costs. A timely relational 
      breakthrough can prevent expensive misalignments and wasted development cycles. When ethical 
      depth matters as much as technical prowess, investing in personal clarity safeguards your 
      reputation, mission, and the future of your work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fast-moving AI world, the cost of skipping integration is monumental: one hour spent 
      on coaching today can save you hundreds of hours tomorrow—and unlock exponential value for 
      your research and career.
    </p>
